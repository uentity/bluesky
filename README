BlueSky integration platform

To build BlueSky kernel you need:
 1. Python (>=2.5)
 2. Boost libraries (>=1.46)
 3. Loki library
 4. SCons - build system

1) To build kernel without python support to exe/debug simply run:
scons -u
2) To build release:
scons -u build_kinds=release
Build debug similar:
scons -u build_kinds=debug
Both release and debug:
scons -u build_kinds=debug,release
3) To add python support:
scons ... py=1
4) To make install somewhere:
scons ... install=1 prefix=[kernel_prefix] [plugin_prefix=[...]]
5) In order to customize build, setup library paths, etc, you'll need to create/edit
scons_env.custom
and possibly
scons_vars.custom
scripts.
